# Recommendation System Tuning with Implicit Feedback

## Idea: I am using PPO to optimize recommendations based on clickstream/log data.
### Approach -- I am planning to combine supervised learning (to model behavior) + PPO (to optimize long-term engagement)


## - Dataset: MovieLens, Retailrocket recommender dataset

## - State: User features, previous interactions, time of day

## - Action: Recommend top-N items

## - Reward: +1 if clicked/viewed, 0 otherwise
